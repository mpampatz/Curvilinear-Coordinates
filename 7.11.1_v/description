   Curvilinear coordinates x1, x2, x3 are transformed to zeta, eta, theta
   such that ...
       sin(zeta) = 1/x1
       sin(eta)  = x2
       tan(theta)  = sqrt(1-x3^2) / x3

   The curvilinear system is z-axissymmetric.

   Holding x3 constant surface coordinates are planes.
   Angle theta defines rotation about the z-axis

   Holding x1 constant surface coordinates are tori.
   z-axis is the axis of their symmetry while the core cycle lies on the
   xy-plane.
   Angle zeta defines:
   -the core cycle radius R = 1/cos(zeta)
   -the tube radius       r = tan(zeta)
   Thus x1 is the ratio   x1 = R/r = 1/sin(zeta)
   The physical meaning of x1 and zeta follows.

   Holding x2 constant surface coordinates are spheres.
   Their centers lie on the z-axis. Its like they sit on (or hang from) the
   ring x^2+y^2=a^2.
   Angle eta defines:
   -the center Zc = tan(eta)
   -the radius R  = 1/cos(eta)
   Thus x2 is the ratio x2 = sin(eta) = Zc/R
   The physical meaning of x2 and eta follows.

   The surface of the plot is a plane for which x3 is held constant.
   Cross sections of tori are displayed red.
   Cross sections of upper spheres are displayed blue.
   Cross sections of lower spheres are displayed green.
